# Video Content Automation Platform

Platform for video analysis and social media content creation.

## Stack

- **Frontend**: Vite, React, TypeScript, Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Fastify, Drizzle ORM, Lucia Auth
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Redis (Docker)

## Setup

**Prerequisites:** Docker Desktop, Node.js 20+

1. First time only — copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Cloudflare R2 credentials (see [docs/CLOUDFLARE_R2_SETUP.md](./docs/CLOUDFLARE_R2_SETUP.md)):
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your R2_ACCOUNT_ID, R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID, R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, R2_BUCKET_NAME, R2_ENDPOINT
   ```

2. Start everything with one command:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will:
   - Start Docker (Postgres, Redis, screencast-worker)
   - Wait for Redis to be ready
   - Apply the database schema
   - Start backend (port 3000) and frontend (port 5173)

3. Open http://localhost:5173 (or 5174)

## Screencast Recording (Add Video by URL)

When you add a video by pasting a replay URL, the system records the screen and audio from that page:

- **Backend** enqueues a job in BullMQ and returns immediately
- **Screencast worker** (runs in Docker) opens the URL in Chromium, records with FFmpeg + PulseAudio, uploads to R2

The screencast worker runs automatically when you use `npm run dev`. It reads R2 credentials from the root `.env` file.

For **live preview** (the image you see while recording is what the Docker worker is actually capturing), set `BACKEND_URL` and `SCREENCAST_PREVIEW_SECRET` in `.env`. Use the same secret value so the worker can send frames to the backend; e.g. `BACKEND_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3000` and any random string for `SCREENCAST_PREVIEW_SECRET`.
